# peer-tools

This is a collection of command line tools which are somewhat common in my workflows depending on
which machine I am using, but are also often required / depended upon by other packages and tools.
By design these are all things which can be installed via a package manager, are kept up to date by
the system, and are occasionally invoked _by me directly_.
